		"Scans show mountains in shape of a human face, when seen from orbit. Coincidence?",
		"There is an abandoned ancient imperial Starport. Looks oddly intact for an installation this old.",
		"A strange and very alien ship is in orbit around the southern hemisphere. It leaves orbit and jumps as soon as it is scanned..",
		"This world’s oceans are bioluminescent, and are hauntingly beautiful at night.",
		"Every 81 minutes, there is a burst of interference on all radio spectrums, originating from somewhere on the surface.",
		"There is a plant on this world that can be made into a powerful drug that increases intelligence, and removes the need for sleep. However, it seems to have a curious effect on DNA over time, causing physical mutations that the subject is blind to.",
		"This world is protected by a force shield which can severely damage any ships who try to land without knowing the secret codes. If there is a local civilization with a TR below 9, then they are not aware of the shield, and could not have built it.",
		"There appears to be a large number of destroyed robot drones on largest moon or nearby asteroid. 2d6 of them are still active, and will launch to attack any ship that approaches.",
		"There appears to be a hive on the surface of the world, and a large number of non-native insectoid aliens.",
		"What was that? It looked like a wormhole opened for a second, just outside the planet’s orbit..?",
		"This world’s star is a “star whale” breeding ground. There will be 1d4 whales in the hot zone of the system, ‘Grazing’ (absorbing stellar radiation from the brightest star in the system).",
		"There appears to be a large mirrored silver sphere floating on the surface of this planet's star.",
		"There is a decrepit orbital station in a decaying orbit.",
		"There are a number of approximately 1,000-meter tall clusters of crystals on the planet’s surface.",
		"There is a species of herd animal on this world, that appears to graze in large and oddly precise geometric patterns.",
		"There is a ship or space station in orbit (TR 13) and is in perfect working order. Its only inhabitants are 3d8 small multi-legged robots. The original owners have been gone many decades, but the robots have kept the ship in perfect condition, awaiting their return. They are programmed to take care of their masters’ every need, and will eagerly try to service the PCs, as they are guests. Unfortunately, their builders were alien, and have tastes and needs that are unpleasant or even lethal to other species. The robots will not allow any technology to be taken from the ship, and any attempt to do so, (or damage the ship or robots) will cause them to switch to defense mode and attack the PCs directly, as well as decompress the ship.",
		"Curious effect of this planet's atmosphere and its star's light makes the color red appear to be blue. PCs will not notice it until they are on the surface.",
		"Upon entering the planet’s range, a badly distorted radio signal will frantically warn the ship to not land there ‘again’. The voice sounds eerily like that of one of the PCs.",
		"On the southern continent, there is an isolated community of TR0 savages who worship a curious 7 sided pillar jutting out of the plains. If the PCs approach, they will have to convince the savages to allow them to examine the pillar, which hums slightly and can cause nosebleeds. Any PCs who spend more than an hour in its presence will all have an identical vivid dream about a rich and beautiful undiscovered world 5d10 parsecs away.",
		"The surface of this world is pockmarked with what appear to be ancient craters. There are remnants of a human civilization here (several TR 8 ruined cities) but no immediately detectable inhabitants.",
		"A ship emitting a distress call is detected, but is in fact part of a pirate trap. The pirates have contracted a disease from spores on a local planet, and seek to get medical supplies the only way they know how.",
		"A 3-mile-long, non-functioning, automated mining ship is located in an asteroid belt near the planet. PCs will have to scan the belt to notice the ship—its core is breaking down and it is somewhat radioactive. Its hold contains a large amount of refined metals, rare minerals and gems that it processed before it broke down.",
		"(If planet has humans with TR 2-8, otherwise reroll) The inhabitants are pleasant folks, who will believe the PCs are from some other part of their world. In fact they believe they are the only beings in the universe, and the idea of alien life is anathema to them. If shown conclusive proof of life on other worlds, they will quickly turn violent and seek to lynch the offworlders.",
		"This system is along an alien trade route. The closest gas giant to this planet is home to a trading station that is broadcasting advertisements on several frequencies. PCs can dock and seek to trade or buy tech, but the alien merchants are very sharp, and good at spotting easy marks. Currency is not accepted here, only barter. There are several types of species of alien here, and a wide variety of goods and services are offered. Theft, murder, and endangering the station are the only infractions punished, and the definition of these can be interpreted broadly. The guards are all to happy to subdue troublemakers and toss them out an airlock. Most of the merchants have ensured that the guards see their side of any disputes with customers. The station is dirty. The DM should secretly roll a d10 once per day spent on the station for each PC, and if a ‘1’ is rolled, that PC contracts a bizarre alien disease. The DM should also roll again for each meal eaten there, and any for extensive personal contact with a station denizen. It is possible to contract multiple diseases.",
		"Space spores—this planet's system is infested with them. The hull of the PCs’ ship will gradually be covered by a tough lichen-like space growth. It will corrode the hull, leading to hull breaches if left long enough. Prior to that, it will disrupt sensor effectiveness after 1d4 weeks. It has a chameleon-like ability and appears to be the color of whatever it grows on, making it difficult to spot initially. It will take inventiveness or a fully stocked shipyard to completely remove. TR 13+ starports and stations will refuse entry for infected ships.",
		"This habitable world has a species of cute fuzzy creatures that seem like the perfect pet. Sooo cute, and so friendly, you feel like you could pet them for days... (Psionic characters get a headache from them.)",
		"There is a weird, shifting color energy field near this planet. It seems to follow the ship, always staying just at the edge of sensor range. It will follow them as long as they are in the system.",
		"Floating in orbit is what appears to be the mummified corpse of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Weird.",
		"A super-intelligent energy being inhabits this planet. It has been content to observe how the ‘lesser’ races in this system develop over the millennia, but something about the PCs has piqued its interest, and it has decided to give them a test. It has the ability to create holographic illusions and control energy on a massive scale, but is incorporeal, and can only communicate psychically. It is somewhat pedantic in its thinking, and if tricked through logic, it will keep its word.",
		"When approaching this planet for the first time, the ship will pass through a strange magenta energy field. Nothing will appears to have happened, but the field was a space-time distortion. The ship and all its inhabitants have been shrunk by 50%. They will not realize it at first, and all of their sensor readings will be somewhat off, but they will assume that the planets and local lifeforms are just unusually large. (They may suspect, but will not know for sure until they visit a human colony, or revisit a location that they have visited before.) The distortion field is in an erratic orbit around the star, and it may take some work to find again, and figure out how to pass through it in such a way to reverse the effect. (Doing so incorrectly will continue to shrink the ship by 50% each time.",
		"On this world there is a vast and destroyed city overgrown by jungle, (if a garden world). At its center, under the shattered remains of their largest temple is a machine complex that is able to ‘resurrect’ anyone who dies on or near this planet. (The range of the effect extends one planetary radius beyond the planet’s atmosphere.) The machine works by automatically generating a replicant of the deceased, if they died anywhere in its range. The resurrected emerges from the machine naked but with otherwise identical to themselves at the moment of death. (Cybernetic implants and scars are not reproduced. Any missing limbs or other body parts are fixed. However all resurrected also gain a prehensile tail for some reason.) The individual has little to work with, but there are enough odds and ends in the city to build a working transmitter if they have the technical expertise. If there is an indigenous culture on the planet, there would be a monastery in the city ruins whose ‘monks’ capture the revived, and send them to a necropolis separate from the living.",
		"This world seems like it is going through a major seismic event—numerous simultaneous volcanic eruptions around the planet are causing massive earthquakes, tidal waves, etc. If inhabited by intelligent life, the population is being devastated. If over TR 10, a planetary evacuation is underway.",
		"There is a comet passing through the system near this world and approaching the star(s) at a high rate of speed. Sensors indicate that the nucleus of the comet is oddly metallic.",
		"(If this planet is in a multi-star system) When the stars are scanned, sensors will show that there is some sort of blueish energy beam extending between two of the stars, and at one of the LaGrangian points between them, suspended in the beam, is a cylindrical object. Solar winds and radiation noise make it difficult to get a clearer image.",
		"There is a faint radio signal emitting from the north pole of the one of the planet’s moons. Investigation will reveal the remains of a crashed ship, still broadcasting a distress signal. The only inhabitant is an advanced android of alien craftsmanship. It is quite helpful, and will join with the PCs, if asked. It is particularly skilled at Jump engine maintenance. It will take the android about a day to learn the PCs language. When asked, it claims to have no memory of what caused the crash. In fact, it will be somewhat evasive when asked any questions about its past.",
		"When passing through this system, a swarm of small glowing ‘bugs’ will become attracted to the ship. Shortly thereafter, the ship will begin losing power at an alarming rate. The bugs will not follow the ship into a planet’s atmosphere, but will return once the ship returns to space. They are attracted to energy sources, and will ignore a powered-down ship. A ship will not be able to successfully jump with them around the ship. They are too small and fast moving to be stopped by conventional ships weapons, but they do have a weakness if the PCs can find it.",
		"There is an interstellar visitor base (roll Xenotype and Tech Level from Step H) on one of the uninhabited planets or moons. Upon investigation, the PCs find that all of the visitors are dead, having apparently turned their weapons on each other just a few hours previously. Much of their technology was destroyed in the firefight, but there are some salvageable items, weapons, and supplies. No indication of what caused this violent behavior, except for a recording where the leader warns “...the demons are pulling the strings...”",
		"If there is a former human colony in this system, they appear to be TR 4, and are a perfect copy of their original culture at that point in history. They in fact do not realize that they are not on Earth, but simply think they are in a remote part their kingdom, cut off from the settled lands.",
		"On the surface of one planet there is a black disk. This disk is 58.3km in diameter, and is perfectly flat and completely frictionless. Laser instruments will not be able to find an imperfection, and there is no dust or sand on its surface. Tools do not seem to have the ability to even scratch its surface.",
		"In this system, one of the gas giants is being pulled into a singularity (tiny black hole), as evidenced by the fact it has broken orbit and has a long tendril of gas spiraling into a nearby point at the center of its new orbit. A garden world is also seemingly caught in its pull and has been dragged out of its orbital path, toward the singularity.",
		"There is a space junkyard orbiting this world. Could be something worth salvaging among those ancient hulks.",
		"Space whale carcass floating in orbit around this planet's star. Possibly killed by errant solar flare, or something else...",
		"While approaching this planet, a giant, organic-looking black ship jumps out of FTL near the PC’s ship. It seems to study them for about 5 minutes, and then jumps again.",
		"If the PCs land and explore the surface, they will be disturbed by ghostly images of people from their past. The figures will stay just out of reach, but generally seem happy. Further investigation will find a nearby alien graveyard, with a opalescent sphere on a pedestal that seems to be some kind of holographic projector. Covering the sphere will make the images go away. Trying to remove the sphere from the pedestal will break it irrevocably.",
		"In the vicinity of this planet, the PCs will find a passing alien ship which will inquire if they are interested in trade. They will find the aliens are slave traders, and have a wide variety of sad looking slaves of various races (including human) for sale. They are well-armed, and lack a sense of humor.",
		"Orbiting this world is a space brothel, run by a 300kg inscectoid pimp named Bar-thak. Their host will allow the PCs as long as they have coin to trade, but if they get too nosey about the sizable off-limits area. The space brothel is in fact a front operation for smugglers. Bar-thak’s goons will try to kick the PCs out an airlock. (Note, Alpha Blue could be a good resource for fleshing out the station further.)",
		"Shortly after arriving at this world, a ship will approach the PC's ship. It is an exploratory ship from a nearby hex, where a TR 10 world has just discovered FTL. The PCs are the first offworlders encountered by this race. (Roll 1d6: 1-4 is human, 5-6 alien race.)",
		"While scanning this world, the ship picks up a garbled message from a world about 2d4 parsecs away that seems to be a plea for help, and something about a deadly outbreak of plague on their world.",
		"Sensors pick up an alien ship in outer orbit around this world—it appears to be of unknown design, and very old and damaged. It is a derelict that has already been picked over. The hold however is full of 1 meter diameter spheres that seem to be full of a pale orange liquid. (Roll 1d6: 1-2 it’s alien eggs, 3-4 it’s a shipment of an popular alien soft drink, 5-6 it’s a load of expired alien fertility pharmaceuticals, which probably have no effect on other species.)",
		"Free trade starport located here. Frequented by TR 10-13 species from this quadrant. The starport is dank and crowded, and anything imaginable is for sale, but everything has a price. (Example: PCs will need to purchase “Atmo vouchers” good for 15 minutes of breathing station air. Being caught breathing station air without a voucher must pay a hefty fine/bribe or face losing a lung to the organ bank.)",
		"A luxury spaceliner from a Tech Level 12 world several parsecs away is dallying at this world. The crew (and passengers) are condescending and snooty to lower tech cultures. Not inclined to associate with space riff-raff.",
		"This system is teeming with a bio-organism (like space plankton) that will silently build up on the ship’s hull interfering with the ship’s ability to make a jump. Getting the ship’s jump capability working again requires painstaking scraping off of the hull in key areas, or finding a way to remove it long enough make the jump. (The organism loves light, so the closer the ship gets to the sun, the faster it builds up.)",
		"There is a crashed ship in a marshy area on the surface (if it is a garden planet). Its fusion core is still operating, and it is full of hundreds of cryotubes, of which 3 are still operating and have living occupants. This ship was delivering a load of 'mail order brides' to a new human colony. If they are woken up, the occupants will not be sure how much time has passed, or exactly where their destination is. (The ship’s computer can reveal the delivery coordinates if repaired.)",
		"In a wilderness area, there is a ruin visible from the air. The stone complex is overgrown with vines and is long forgotten, but actually is an old temple. It houses a pylon that is far older than this planet's civilization (if there is one). The pylon is malfunctioning, and anyone who meddles with it suffers a permanent effect: (roll 1d4: 1: Makes them an albino, but also now has natural night vision. Regular sunlight is blinding to PC and their skin burns very easily. 2: They grow 1/2 meter in height, and their strength increases by an additional 50%. Their metabolism can now only process protein anything, and else makes the PC violently ill. 3: They suffer a devolutionary effect, and grow ape-like features. Lose 25% INT, but gain additional 50% DEX. Also has acute sense of smell. 4: INT increases by additional 50%, and gains one psychic ability. The PC’s head gets slightly bigger (but they are now completely bald). The pylon can only affect a given character once.",
		"There is an A.I. missile called a Nova Bomb floating in space near this world. It has limited robot intelligence, but has developed self-awareness, and a concept of self-preservation. It has lost its will to detonate and destroy this planet. It can be reasoned with, and may reveal who sent it, and why.",
		"This planet's star has a research station in low orbit around it, with a long metallic probe extending down into the star's core. The temperature on the station is very hot, near the boiling point. If investigated the PCs will find that the station's crew apparently died in some panic, having been “diamond-ized” at some point.",
		"Half a space ship is drifting though this planet's system, its engines and rear portion having been destroyed in some incident. It is being 'piloted' by a cranky android, who is patiently waiting for the ship to reach to his destination 2d8 parsecs away. He doesn't want to be rescued, and will actively resist being removed from his ship. He does have access to a considerable database of information, and is willing to answer questions in exchange for useful parts or resources.",
		"Bears. This world is overrun by vicious bear-like creatures. If no life possible on this planet, then they are mechanical, selfreplicating bears.",
		"While in the vicinity of this world, a patrol ship will stop and board the PC's ship to conduct interrogations. If the PCs resist or try to flee, the patrol will use a stun field effect on the ship to knock out the PC's and their crew. The patrol is hunting for smugglers in this zone of space who have been selling forbidden materials. Any contraband on the PCs’ ship will be confiscated. The patrol is from a nearby high tech rating world.",
		"This planet has (in addition to any locals ) a brand new TR 9 agricultural colony that has only been there for 4 years. They could really use some help from the PCs, but don't have a lot to trade. (They do make a tasty BBQ however.)",
		"If there is intelligent life on this planet, however they are in fact a previously encountered visitor race in disguise. Their settlement seems innocent enough, but it conceals a secret underground military base, and is a vital part of a larger invasion plan. They will attempt to maintain the deception as long as the PCs are in the system, and show them some simple hospitality. However they will try to kill the PCs if their secret is discovered, in order to prevent them from revealing their secret to their enemies.",
		"Something here gives humans an itchy rash if they walk around exposed to the atmosphere. The rash lasts for 2d8 days, and scratching it causes green pustules to form. The pustules will sprout tendrils that grow to 10cm in length. If left alone, they will dry up and fall off on their own. But every time there is an attempt to cut a tendril, it adds another 1d8 days to the condition clearing up. Local species may have a better cure, but generally will recommend just 'don't pick at it.'",
		"In an asteroid belt near this world, PCs will detect a small defenseless ship fleeing a larger assault ship. Both are piloted by an alien species. The assault ship will try to capture the small ship with grapples, and will take it back home with it. If the PCs help the small ship escape, they will find a single alien occupant, who will claim to be a persecuted scientist escaping his planet's dictatorial government. He is actually a mad scientist being pursued for his crimes, but he doesn't see it that way. At the first opportunity, he will try to knock out the PCs and their crew, and use them to continue his experiments. He has advanced scientific technology on his ship (TR 15) that only he can operate. He is very interested in making the perfect being, and will try to use his 'subjects' as recipients of his genius, or as spare parts. (His idea of perfection is based on his race's ideals, rather than on humanity's.) He is able to make nearly perfect duplicates/clones of any of his subjects using one of his machines, and will make duplicates of anyone undergoing an experiment (as a control group.)",
		"Large ship (50x bigger than PC's ship) passing through this planet's system from another dimension. Aliens on board are scientists exploring our dimension, and collecting samples of alien life. These aliens are 20 meters tall, and have alien thought processes. They can be reasoned with, and are not malicious, but are not especially sympathetic to the PC’s point of view either.",
		"This planet is a low-tech farm colony—workers are kept drugged, docile, and happy as they toil in the fields. The overseers will show deference to the PCs, but also may try to drug the PCs’ food to add them to their work force.",
		"This planet has an island with a single 'human' settlement. The settlement is made up of androids, who have low technology, except for an ancient factory unit that is able to take a single piece of DNA and make a perfect android duplicate, even with the same memories of up to the moment the sample was taken from the donor. The androids are able to live about 10 years before they are recycled. The colony has a supply of DNA they use to recreate themselves, but it is running out, and they do not know how to build other types of technology. (Their DNA is derived from simple farmers who died out a long time ago.) They are willing to trade for DNA from individuals who have more advanced technical knowledge. This planet is in the process of being terraformed. There are 6 giant robot ships orbiting it, radically altering its atmosphere and hydrosphere. Every time the PCs’ ship gets too close, the robot ships will launch a missile at the PC’s ship. It is a homing missile which can travel slightly faster than the PCs’ ship's max movement. It has a range of 1 million miles, but if the PCs can get more then 1000 miles away from it, the missile will shut down and go dormant. The missile is not intelligent, and is very bad at making tight turns.",
		"Planet has violent storms. Tornadoes/waterspouts are a constant feature of the atmosphere, and multiple funnels can be frequently be seen at once while on the surface.",
		"This planet has a religious shrine that attracts pilgrims from multiple worlds. The shrine is also home to a colony of brightly colored beetles that give possibly prophetic visions when allowed to attach themselves to the back of the neck. The beetles only live in the area around the shrine, and will die within a day or two of being removed from their habitat.",
		"A cave system on this world houses an exclusive vault in an insect hive, used by traders, smugglers, and the like to keep valuables and contraband safe. For a fee, the insect bankers will hold anything for anyone in their vaults. They have nearly matchless security—a legion of warrior caste with deadly stingers and charge an appropriately high rate for their services. Their queen handles all negotiations.",
		"The ecosystem of this world is very delicate, and if the PCs wander around without any kind of mask on, they will release a virus that will start killing off the local animal life. If there is native civilization, they may react poorly to the PCs, and seek to capture the PCs to use their blood to find a cure.",
		"This world has a secret reconnaissance base for a nearby space empire. The scouts are in suspended animation, but their computer will wake them 1d4 days after the PCs arrive. They will begin transmitting encrypted reports to their home base describing the PCs’ activities.",
		"The natives of this world are incredibly attracted to the PCs. If intelligent, they find the PCs’ race/culture extremely attractive and fascinating. If there is no intelligent life, then something in the PCs’ scent is similar to mating pheromones of local wildlife. If no there is life on this world at all, then there is a high percentage of powerful magnetic ore in the rocks and gravel of this world, causing steel/Iron to become coated with grit and gravel, or become stuck to larger rocks.",
		"This world has huge, floating clusters of a moss type lifeform that crowds the skies. It naturally extracts hydrogen from the atmosphere/water, which gives it its lift. An ecosystem entirely different from the planet’s surface exists on the moss islands. It is difficult to land/walk on the moss islands, since they are always bobbing like balloons, and have a soft spongy consistency. Also there is the exploding part.",
		"There is the broken remains of a collapsed orbital beanstalk lying across a mountain range of this world. It seems unrelated to any other civilization that may exist on this world.",
		"There are an order of monks (or something similar) on this world who make and sell a liquor that is amazing, and quite potent. (If this world has TR 11+ or no native Intelligence, then the monks came here from another world, and export their liquor via a ship that visits once every couple of months.)",
		"The PCs encounter a weird curvilinear ship with advanced amoeboid aliens who state they need assistance returning to the 8th dimension, and will ask to dock. However, they are inter-dimensional slavers who do not follow linear time—and gradually they will enslave the PCs in their pasts thus changing the present. When a change happens, all of the PCs will simultaneously forget that one of the PCs was part of the crew, and instead now believe he/she was always property of the amoeboids. The referee should randomly pick a PC once every few hours and roll a d6 to find what role their altered past has made them think they are now: 1-2 worker slave, 3-4 pleasure slave, 5 entertainer/jester, 6 cruel overseer. (Note: the amoeboids are not interested in humans except as merchandise.) Coming into contact with energy from the 8th dimensional ship will temporarily return the PC’s own original memories for 1d4 hours. Destroying the inter-dimensional ship’s tachyon drive will undo all their temporal meddling.",
		"Alien scientists on a mission of exploration are eager to learn from the PCs and about their home world—very eager to the point of being pushy. They have advanced medical techniques and can offer augmentations if they are allowed to perform detailed biological scans.",
		"In this system is a rickety ship operated by a friendly but standoffish prospector. He has found a rich pocket of Karolite ore, but has to wait for a tidally locked moon to be eclipsed by another moon so he can mine it. He is worried and antsy since the eclipse will occur soon. His ship has a mining laser that is devastatingly powerful, but slow to recharge. He will use it if he thinks the PCs are going to “jump his claim”.",
		"Every 35 hours, a star in this system flares, blanketing the system in a psychic wave. Make a secret roll 1d6 for anyone observing the flare. Add +1 to roll for psychic characters 1. Nothing 2. Migraine headache 3. Temporarily see only in black and white 4. Paranoia: (thinks best friends are evil, enemies are allies) 5. Ecstatic: feeling unusually affectionate 6. Prophetic visions: has flashes of things about to happen 7. Boost of psi powers by 5x. Lasts only during a flare but (at the referee’s discretion) the PC can permanently gain a lesser psi boost. Roll again without the +1 modifier.",
		"Advanced shipyard in this system (orbiting star if no indigenous civilizations) can make repairs and improvements for a fee (no credit or currency—only accepts exotic metals and ore).",
		"There is an old alien escape pod drifting here. It holds the corpse of an alien, and some advanced, if mysterious technology. The pod’s computer core is damaged, but contains trace amounts of nanites. If the nanites contaminate another ship, they will “repair” its computer, making it more powerful... and also sapient.",
		"Religious festival in this system (if no indigenous civilization, than they are visitors there as part of a pilgrimage) honoring the blessed moon of Ix, an ice moon covered by aurora borealis. A band of zealots from a rival order planning a series of bombings. The church is wealthy and will pay handsomely for the culprits to be captured. The aurora interferes with energy weapons making them difficult to aim.",
		"Space whalers have constructed an entire city on the back of a large space whale. They hunt other space whales, allowing their captured whale to lead them to the herds. Friendly and generous folk otherwise, who don't understand why anyone else would be shocked by their livelihood.",
		"PCs pick up a ship at the edge of their sensors that seems to be following them. If they give chase it will appear to flee to an asteroid belt. In fact, it is a sensor ghost created by an ancient gravimetric minefield trying to draw ships into it. The mines are hidden among the asteroids, but the core is housed in a bombed-out, secret base on a small planetoid near the center of the minefield. Every hour in the field requires a normal piloting check to avoid collisions, and every round in the field the mines are active requires a ship’s weapon roll to destroy any approaching mines. (A difficult piloting roll can also be used to dodge mines.)",
		"Ship or hidden colony of humanoids. They are in fact bioroids—artificial human workers with synthetic brains. They stole a ship and fled their home system seeking refuge from persecution from 'the Naturals'. They can change their appearance to be even more pleasing to the PCs in about 10 hours, based on what they learn about the PC’s tastes. They want help but don't trust non-synthetics. Also many of their memories are artificial, and some have dormant programming that can be triggered by stressful situations.",
		"A planet in this system is currently being terraformed by a massive planetoid robot ship. Science rolls can tell that is being terraformed to be very hot and swampy, and the ship has another 600 years of work to do on this world.",
		"On an inhospitable planet or moon there is a dome emitting a faint energy signature. Inside there is a perfect 20th century town with about 120 inhabitants. They were abducted from western Pennsylvania in 1958 by unknown aliens and brought here, town and all. They have been here ever since, with no contact from the mysterious aliens. Their secret is that the dome is failing, and a hidden readout in the town hall shows how many people the dome can support. The town will kill the PCs or members of the town to return to that population number. (Every time they have a birth in that town they have a lottery to see who will have to be in turn sacrificed.)",
		"This system is the temporary home of a clan of space gypsies. They have a amalgamated worldship built from a variety of derelicts. They will offer to dock and trade with the party, and aside from some petty larceny will be honest traders. They will move on to a new system about once every 4 months.",
		"The asteroid belt in this system is quite rich in rare minerals, but the party will have to perform a detailed scan in the belt to discover this fact. Its location could be traded for a nice profit.",
		"While in this system, sensors can pick up a static-laden radio signal that seem to be from old earth, from within the star.",
		"One of the moons in this system has a deep crevasse that contains evidence of atmosphere—If a small ship is taken about 3 km down, they will find breathable atmosphere, and a strange subterranean environment. (Starting at Step F, roll the subsequent steps for this lush interior environment.)",
		"One of the planets in this system has a swarm of alien robots that attack and consume anything metal, and are able to quickly replicate more of themselves. They are a menace to anything technological on the planet, and are difficult to destroy.",
		"On one of these worlds there is an ancient ruined city, and at its center is a great domed library that is mostly intact. At the center of the library is a holographic librarian that will answer questions posed to it. Unfortunately it is old and breaking down, and its databases have been merged. Every third question it answers it will unwittingly take from a work of alien fiction or mythology.",
		"Psychic characters or NPCs in this system will hear a humming that no one else can hear. They will soon feel an urge to travel to the innermost planet in this system. The closer they get to it, the stronger the urge, until they will turn violent and attempt to hijack their ship. This will persist until they are removed from the system or die. They are being drawn to a trio of basalt pillars in the middle of a desert plain, and when and if they reach the pillars, they will stand blankly in the middle of them until they die of exposure. Littered around the pillars in the dust are the remains of a variety of alien species from over the eons—otherwise, there is little of interest at these pillars. If they are subsequently taken from the system, they will gradually recover over 2 weeks, and find their psychic powers somewhat increased.",
		"A species in this system believes that the their gods resemble humans (or the race of an alien member of the party). They will see them as avatars of their gods, and want to treat those party members accordingly. Unfortunately this species believes they must eat their gods to reach the afterlife—and assume the party is aware of this fact of their culture too. (They just need a little taste each, but there are a lot of them).",
		"There is a negotiation going on in this system for mineral rights on one of the planets. A variety of alien delegates are here to bid for exclusive rights. Various factions may seek to hire the party to help their objectives (or murder their rivals.)",
		"Two fleets of TR 13 warships are battling in this system. They will ignore the PCs’ ship unless the PCs become involved. In fact these ships are performing a combat exercise, and belong to the same empire, but take their wargames very seriously.",
		"There is a comet in this system that is quite large. If they check, the party will find that the comet is going to collide with the a world in the system in about 4 weeks.",
		"One of the planets in this system gives off strange energy readings. Due to an ancient alien experiment, there is a temporal fracture on the planet, centered on the ruins of the old alien research complex. Different areas of the planet’s surface have time moving at different rates, or skipping out of order. (Some of the aliens are still trapped in a frozen moment of time at the center of the complex.) PCs won’t notice the timeskip effect unless they separate from each other. Each separate group will gain or lose 1d20 -10 hours for every hour on the surface. Only those outside the planet’s atmosphere will be able to observe the correct rate at which time is passing.",
